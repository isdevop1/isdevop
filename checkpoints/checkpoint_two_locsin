	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
		I feel like we do not need DevOps the way we need food and water to survive. I personally believe that DevOps is like
		getting a newer, faster computer for work. It is an optional yet imperative upgrade to the silos your organization built.
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
		Continuous Integration is about collaboration in code. This concept contains the idea of code from developers being
		regularly integrated into a shared repository.

		Continuous Delivery is about wrapping up said code into a unit that can be ready to be produced.

		Continuous Deployment talks about the actual release of said code along with streamlined updates sent directly to the user
		without the need for checking.
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
		I feel like the hardest part is more of integrating into a DevOps framework. Change is always hard, especially for organizations
		with big names and big productions. There is always a risk in changing the work ethic and lifestyle of an organization,
		so it will always be a risk to move.
