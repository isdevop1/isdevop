1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
CI stands for continuous integration, a fundamental DevOps best practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run. But CD can either mean continuous delivery or continuous deployment.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
It is the implementation of the different toolkits between development and operations teams. Identifying and synchronizing any difference between the two is the most significant part of making everything work properly.
