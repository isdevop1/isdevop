*    ISDEVOPS INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY 1
*********************************************

For this activity, kindly do the following

1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:
    <ISDEVOPS>_Surname; so it should look something like: ISDEVOPS_Mendoza

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:
    Name: Aedan Mikhel B. Matienzo
    Favorite Movie: Harry Potter Series
    Favorite Band: ITZY (Kpop Group, don't have any favorite bands hehe)
    Favorite Song: Dalla Dalla by ITZY
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: a source code management tool that promotes collaboration among different people/teams.

5. Push everything to our isdevops_activit1 branch
