1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

Yes, DevOps is a set of practices that is, in one word, innovative and solves a lot of the modern development problems with the set of practices and methods it offers. With a lot of business adopting DevOps, some live and breath DevOps, therefore, we need DevOps.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

Continuous Integration (CI) is where developers merge code changes into a central repository, where builds and tests are done automatically, while Continuous Delivery (CD) extends this by automating the software release as well, making it available for access, and finally, Continuous Deployment (CD) is where the product/software is put into the production environment, essentially "extending" or going one step further from Continuous Delivery.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework may be the actual adoption of the framework/set of practices itself, looking at it as a student and potential professional in the field. Like with adopting new technology such as Cloud Computing, an organization/business may find it hard to transition from their original framework, to a DevOps framework, posing risks, costs, but at the same time, if successful, increase value, productivity, and decrease costs and risks in the long term.
