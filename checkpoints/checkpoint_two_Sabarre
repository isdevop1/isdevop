1. Yes I think we really need DevOps because it allows organizations to develop newer products faster and more efficiently
2. Continous integration (CI)is having code be regularly merged into a shared code repository and application of automated functioons to be more efficient and avoid code conflicts
	Continous Delivery (CD) is packaging code into deliverable units that could be deployed into production easily
	Continous Deployment (CD) is the automated relase of code updates to the user without them having to look or do it manually
3. The most challenging part is really the mentallity of the people that will implement it as to really make sure that DevOps may be able to do its thing, you need to be able to buy in to DevOps and its methodology
