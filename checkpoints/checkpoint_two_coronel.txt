1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

     Yes, I believe that DevOps is needed to provide a smoother flow and transition between 
   the development team and operations team. The DevOps process would overall cater to the needs of 
   both teams and provide better communication and collaboration. The needs of customers would also 
   be addressed easily and allow both teams to continuously integrate, deliver and deploy a system.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

   > CI - Continuous Integration is the process in which developers integrate code changes into a shared
   repository as often as possible to locate and eliminate software defects at an early stage.

   > CD - Continuous Delivery is the process of automating release deployment; although, deployment to production
   is done manually.

   > CD - Continuous Deployment is the process where uploaded code changes are automatically deployed to the production
   environment. Unlike, Continuous Delivery, the changes are immediately visible to the users.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

   I think that using the different software development/integration tools may be a challenge for some developers. 
   It may be possible that new developers are not that familiar with the tools which may cause them to accidentally
   push unnecessary changes that may already affect the overall quality of the system. It must be made sure then that
   proper onboarding be done to all developers to prevent complications like this. Administrative policies should also
   be properly ensured to allow only authorized users or developers to accept changes (pull requests) from other developers
   into the system.
