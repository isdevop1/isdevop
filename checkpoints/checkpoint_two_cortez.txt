1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

DevOps is essential as it is a software development approach that supports 
other previous frameworks and methodologies such as Waterfall and Agile. The 
utilization of DevOps can assist people in creating applications and software efficiently 
without any silos. As time passes, DevOps will show its advantages and faults over time, 
which leads to another approach's creation that is more flexible and adaptive to users' needs.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

Continuous Integration - this is where developers frequently add source code changes to the main branch and automate tests to verify if the code is working as intended.

Continuous Delivery - is an extension of CI and a process of deploying software code ready to be released in a production environment.

Continuous Deployment - Combines both mentioned previous forms and releases the software code immediately and automates deploying changes to production without any manual process.


3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

From my experience, I think the challenging part is adjusting to the tools used for each phase in the framework, 
especially Git, and whether we could follow the continuous cycle if we already have problems starting from the 
code integration part, which would need some practice and adjustments once we get used to the software.
