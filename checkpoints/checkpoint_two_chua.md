1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    For me, we need DevOps because it can help 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    CI (Continuous Integration) is where the developers will be merging their code changes, 
    which will be validated and tested. This is to lessen the defect to achieve a faster development speed.

    CD (Continuous Delivery) is an extension of CI. In this component, the software being made is ready to be released.

    CD (Continuous Deployment) is unlike continuous delivery that the software is ready to be release, 
    but it is already released to the public after the changes have been made and tested. In here every change 
    that the developers have made and successfully integrated to the main branch will be seen by the users.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    It might be the fact that I am not much familiar with the tools being used in the DevOps framework. 
    Being new to the framework and its tools, it might take a while for me to be able to be used to the tools of the framework.
