1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
   The need for DevOps will purely depend on the needs of the business. For example, if a business operates with a model that does not
   require frequently updated software to meet customer demand, DevOps might not be needed. For larger organizations on the other hand, 
   DevOps may be an essential tool to help keep up with competitors and demand.  
2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
   Continuous integration - Testing automation to ensure that the application is not broken whenever new commits are made to the main 
   branch
   Continuous Delivery - Automated release process which can deploy an application any time by clicking a button
   Continuous Deployment Every change that is made is released directly to the customers 
3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
   The most challenging part of DevOps is first considering if it is really needed by the business and, if they would have the right tools
   and be able to adjust to support the process
