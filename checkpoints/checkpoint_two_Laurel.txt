	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
		yes because it helps us create meaningful programs and deliver them on time for the clients. 
		Devops helps connect the developers and the operations team and thus making life easier for both parties
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
	CI(Continous Integration) is basically  building or automatically testing code whenever there is a change.
	Once a developer makes a change to the code, they get integrated into the repository. 
	
	CD( Continous Delivery) is building,testing, and deploying code as soon as they are ready. They are prepared to be in deployment
	
	CD( Continuous Deployment) is almost similar to continous delivery the difference being in CD the code is actually being deployed in the
	production environment. Once the code passes the tests it can now be deployed to the production environment.
	
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
	
	I think it might just be getting used to the framework. Git itself isnt that hard but what may be challenging is getting used to it
