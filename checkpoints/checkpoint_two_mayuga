1. Nowadays, as technology evolves more complications and chaotic work environment within the field has becoming prevalent. In order to make use of technology in delivering high-quality software more faster and efficiently, the concept or the theory of DevOps is highly emphasized. As it fosters a proper order in the collaboration between developement team and operations teams, it reduces the problems these faces team as they work in silos. Hence, making the collaborative work to give a competitive advantage in businesses.
2. CI (Continuous Integration) ensures that the code changes made in a program is being shared to every developers involved in it by establishing a shared git repository. Therefore, it typical challenges when it comes to integreting/merging and testing can be avoided. CD (Continuous Delivery) deploys the code changes made from the CI to a production environment. Lastly, CD (Continuous Deployment) is an extension of CD that involves the automated deploying of the code changes made to the production environment after going through the automated testing. It ensures a quick or lessens the time invested in releasing the improvements to the users. 
3. The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework is most probably the monitoring part because identifying the probable issues and finding a way to resolve is challenging to take. Hence, a lot of skills and talents must be pre-determined before going into this position. Also, in monitoring, one can observed the the maturity level of DevOps because in this part, you can observe the progress from measuring it's performance. This part can also be challenging as it is very difficult to assess a systems performance.
