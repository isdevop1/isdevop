*********************************************

For this activity, kindly do the following

1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:
    <ISDEVOPS>_Surname; so it should look something like: ISDEVOPS_Mendoza

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:
    Name: Terel Lean G. Crisostomo
    Favorite Movie: Avengers and Spider-Man Movies
    Favorite Band: Imagine Dragons
    Favorite Song: I like a lot of songs
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: Helpful for people who want to collaborate on projects effectively and easier

5. Push everything to our isdevops_activit1 branch
