For this activity, kindly do the following

1. In my opinion, we really need DevOps because it will 
	enable faster development and deployment, promotes 
	shorter and controllable iterations, and automation. 
	Streamlining manual processes can provide better speed, 
	greater accuracy, and consistency which are essential
	in an organization in order to provide quality output.
2. Continuous Integration (CI) merge changes back to the main 
	branch/shared repository as often as possible in order to 
	accelerate development speed. 
   Continuous Delivery (CD) is an extension of continuous 
   integration where it automatically deploys all changes to 
   a testing environment which further speeds up development 
   process.
   Continous Deployment (CD) is another step further from 
   continous delivery where changes made are released as soon 
   as any change is made by the developer. Not only it further 
   speeds up development process but it also accelerates the 
   feedback loop with its end users.
3. In my opinion, the most challenging part of observing the 
	DevOps framework is with how multiple teams will work together. 
	Managing multiple environments can be difficult and in DevOps, 
	it is important that these teams are to be integrated together 
	and there must be collaboration. Moreover, these teams can 
	have different cultures/practices hence it is important for all 
	teams to be guided as in DevOps, teams share responsibilities 
	and their work is combined.
