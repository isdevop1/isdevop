1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:

    Favorite Movie: Devil's Wear Prada and The Proposal
    Favorite Band: One Direction and SEVENTEEN
    Favorite Song: Snooze by SZA and 1 step forward and 3 steps back by Olivia Rodrigo
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: a metal door you open before you enter your house, a git (gate) hehe jk! Git is a collaboration tool used by developer with small to large projects.
