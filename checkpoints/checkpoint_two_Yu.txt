1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

	Yes, because DevOps helps facilitate faster decision making, allowing for more efficient and agile development. It can help organizations create a high quality software quicker
	and fewer errors which results to improved customer satisfaction and better user experience.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

	Continuous Integration - is a practice where developers make frequent updates to code, and then are verified by an automated build.
	Continuous Delivery - it automates the process of pushing new code to a non-production environment such as a staging or testing server. This will ensure that the code are safe
	and verified before it gets release to the public.
	Continuous Development - is a strategy where a new code or a change is deployed directly to the production environment after going through a set of rigorous, automated tests.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

	For me, I think the most challenging of observing DevOps framework is it can be difficult to develop and maintain a unified DevOps strategy across the organization,  as it 
	involves multiple teams and various tools. Another possible challenge is that adopting to DevOps requires cultural shift since  DevOps is a collaboration-based methodology, it 
	requires teams to be willing to work together and trust each otherâ€™s opinions and decisions.
