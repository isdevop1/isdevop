1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
---- Yes, DevOps is needed especially in professional settings. The processes and procedures are different when you are working with tens
------or dozens people. DevOps helps alleviate silo culture by promoting collobration.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
---- CI or Continious integration is a principle or components of DevOps where programmers or developers should push to the shared repositosry
as often as possible. This can help with building, verfying and testing code because code is added frequently.
---- The first CD or Continious Delivery is using tools or automation to streamlnie the process of development. It is an extension of CI, wherein
the software being developed can be released at any time.
---- The secon CD or Continious Deployment is a practice where there is a production envronment wherein as soon as a developer chages something,
it is also automatically changed in the production environment.
All three components use tools such as automation, version control software such as GIT and SVN.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
---- Like in many businesses and organizations, it could be hard to transition from one framework to another. It could require lots of capital
and manpower which organizations sometimes cannot justify. It could also be hard for individual developers to change their mindset and work
with others, which is needed in DevOps.
