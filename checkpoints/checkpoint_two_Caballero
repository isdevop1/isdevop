1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
	- For me, I really think that we need DevOps. This is because customers really expect a continuous flow of service and at the highest quality possible, especially in today's world where everything is fast-paced.
2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
	- CI is Continuous Integration, where the developers implement changes in the code as soon as possible.
	- CD is Continuous Delivery, where the software is ready to be implemented in the production at any given time.
	- CD is Contiuous Deployment, where it applies both Continuous Integration and Delivery. This means that as soon as changes are applied to the software, it should be released right away.
3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
	- In my opinion, planning and monitoring can be the most challenging. This is where a person should be really observant and should think ahead of time since this is also where the service will heavily on its continuous work.
