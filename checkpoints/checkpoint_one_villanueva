*    ISDEVOPS INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY 1
*********************************************

For this activity, kindly do the following

1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:
    <ISDEVOPS>_Surname; so it should look something like: ISDEVOPS_Mendoza

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:
    Name: Villanuevam, Adrian John
    Favorite Movie: The Intouchables
    Favorite Band: Covet
    Favorite Song: Get Your Wish
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: a life saviour! :D 

5. Push everything to our isdevops_activit1 branch
