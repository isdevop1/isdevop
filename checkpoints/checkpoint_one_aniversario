*    ISDEVOPS INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY 1
*********************************************

For this activity, kindly do the following

1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:
    <ISDEVOPS>_Surname; so it should look something like: ISDEVOPS_Mendoza

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:
    Name: Samantha Grace S. Aniversario
    Favorite Movie: Devil's Wears Prada and the Proposal (it changes everytime hehe)
    Favorite Band:One Direction
    Favorite Song: Snooze by SZA (atm!!)
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: a metal door you open before entering your house (gate). just kidding hehe!! Git is 
	a great collaboration tool when working on projects that would require sharing of files 

5. Push everything to our isdevops_activit1 branch
