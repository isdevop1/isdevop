1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
Yes, I think we need DevOps to close the distance between the Operations team and the Development team for work to becomes faster, efficient and so that companies would not fall behind with their competitors.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
CI focuses on frequent code integration and testing, CD focuses on automating the release process to staging and production environments, and CD focuses on automating the deployment of code changes to production.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
I think the challenges based on my observations and through discussion in class would be the work habit. Because, before DevOps the development team and the operations team is not really that close and mostly do their works separately. That is why when companies switch to DevOps those two team are now obliged to work together. This could cause trouble at first since they will be doing projects not the way they are used to do at the past but after sometime it would naturally speed up the process of the company.
