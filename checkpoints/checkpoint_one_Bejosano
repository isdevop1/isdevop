*    ISDEVOPS INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITY 1
*********************************************

For this activity, kindly do the following

1. Of course, the fact that you can read this mean you are able to download and setup git on your local machine. And of course, you were able to clone this. So, the first thing that you need to do is to congratulate yourself (yaaaaay!)

2. Next step is to create your local branch
3. Now, on your local branch and inside the isdevopss11 folder, create your own folder:
    <ISDEVOPS>_Surname; so it should look something like: ISDEVOPS_Mendoza

4. Inside this folder, create a README.txt, this README.txt should contain the following:
    Name: Misha Kathleen H. Bejosano
    Favorite Movie: Shotgun Wedding
    Favorite Band: No Doubt
    Favorite Song: Stick Withu
    Then lastly, complete the sentence:
        Git is: used for a source code in DevOps and is very helpful since this handles small to very large projects efficiently. This also tracks changes in the source code which helps developers to work more on the non-linear development.

5. Push everything to our isdevops_activit1 branch
