1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

Yes and no.  I think that DevOps is especially important to use in settings where there are multiple people working on multiple different parts or files of a project at the same time, basically a large scale operation.  However I think that in a small scale, DevOps is not really important but should still be preferred.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

Continuous Integration - Primarily focuses on preventing issues that happen when integrating or releasing a new piece of code by pushing to the main branch as often as possible and by automating testing.
Continuous Delivery - Automatically builds and releases the updated application at the discretion of the DevOps Engineer.
Continuous Deployment - Automatically builds and releases the updated application whenever the update passess all the stages even without input from the DevOps Engineer.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

For me, the most challenging thing about DevOps is having to get used to using new tools to support the process.
