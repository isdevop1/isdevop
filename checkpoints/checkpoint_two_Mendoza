1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
	- We definitely do because projects developed are outputs of which cannot truly be judged and valued by the developers but rather
	the memebrs who would have to utilize/intigrate them into their business processed thus making it ideal and efficient they be highly involved 
	during the process.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD and CD.
	CI - Is the practice of constantly merging changes then validating it against automated tests.
	CD (Delivery) - Improves on CI by automating the merging step through deployment into a testing environment.
	CD (Deploymeny) - Improves on CD (Delivery) by deploying validated changes directly to the customer with no human intervention.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
	- Building the automated tests. Since the goal of DevOps is high velocity it would be detrimental that any automated test applied is actually
	capable and valid otherwise this could result in more issues that would have to be resolved, thus slowing down performance.
