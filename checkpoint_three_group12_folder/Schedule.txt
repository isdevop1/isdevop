#Pseudo Code: Enrollment System (for adding Schedule and Assigning all items together)


function roomAndTime {
	- time is set as 1240H to 215H
	- once the user has selected their chosen subject (in this case, it is ISDEVOP),
	a list will be prompted to the user
	- will pass value of time to checkRoomAvail to check its availability
	- G306A is available as a room at the given time, then it will be assigned as such
	- returns the string for the main function to be evaluated 
}

function checkRoomAvail {
	- if room is not occupied, it is labeled as "vacant" or "open"
	- if it is, then it is marked "closed"
	- if "closed", room will be removed from list 
}

function finalSchedule {
	- This compiles the subject, room no. and time given
	- returns the final schedule to the users
}
