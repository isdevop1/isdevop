PREREQUISITE:
After the leader has created the checkpoint_three_yourGroupname branch, refer to the following instructions:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For this activity, kindly wear the hat of a Quality Assurance Analyst, and write a pseudo test script for the assigned application to your group.

2. In the new working branch (checkpoint_three_yourGroupname), create a folder named checkpoint_three_yourGroupname.

3. After this folder has been created, kindly add, commit, then push this back to origin.

4. Your members should now see your newly created folder and branch.

5. Discuss which part of the assigned app each member will be doing. Once this has been decided, all of the members can now create the topic branch based off on your dev (group) branch: checkpoint_three_yourGroupname. Kindly follow this convention: checkpoint_three_yourSurname; to do this:
git checkout -b checkpoint_three_yourSurname checkpoint_three_yourGroupName

INDIVIDUAL TASK:
1. After you have created your new branch (checkpoint_three_yourSurname), you may now start writing your pseudo-code. BUT, make sure that you are on the right folder (checkpoint_three_yourGroupname)

2. After writing your pseudo-code, please add, commit, then push your work back to the origin. Use the following commands as your guide:
git add <fileName>
git commit -m "description of the commit"
git push origin (if this suggests setting an upstream branch, just follow it), sample:
	git push --set-upstream origin checkpoint_three_mendozaAnswer
