1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
DevOps is important since there are many operations which approaches and enables faster development of new products which is easier to maintain in the existing deployments. This will help 
improve products at a faster pace rather than other organizations using traditional software development. Hence, this also increases the ability of organizations to deliver applications 
faster and easier.


	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
CI/CD refers to the prompt where the practice of building, testing, and deploying software are done in a faster way. This goal is to resolve problems in the development process which reduces 
the market time for improvements. While DevOps on the other hand is known as a set of practices which enhances collaboration and communication between the development and operations team. 
Thus, CI/CD is used to achieve the goal of DevOps in an efficient way.


	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
Based on my experience, the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework is managing multiple environments since as a first timer, this is complex and quickly goes out of control at 
times. Experienced DevOps are used to doing this and they define series of steps which speeds up deployment. By means, the complexity of an application increases and needs to be done in a 
separate way.



2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin


//NOTE: Kindly follow coding/scripting best practice when doing the activity
